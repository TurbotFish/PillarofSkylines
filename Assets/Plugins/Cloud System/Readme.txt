Cloud System
We recommend you to have a look at the example scenes, if you are using the Cloud System for the first time. They can be found in "Assets/Cloud System Demos/Scenes".
Further there is a step by step explanation about how to create a new cloud in "Assets/Plugins/Cloud System/Documentation/Getting Started.pdf". A detailed "Reference.pdf" is also in that folder.
Keep in mind that the Cloud System's inspector GUI already contains a lot of explanations.
